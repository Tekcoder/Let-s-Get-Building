# About The Project:

This project is all about getting the chance to poke around HTTP request from the command line(IRB) and also play around with the new gem called rest-client.

# Built With:

Ruby On Rails.

# Getting Started With The Project:

i. Make sure that youâ€™ve got Rest Client installed by running $ gem install rest-client.
ii. Head into IRB ($ irb).
iii. Run require 'rest-client' to bring the gem into your IRB session.
iv. Use Rest Client to do a Bing search (yes, Bing) and examine the results (you can find the parameters that Bing wants in the URL by simply making a search in a normal browser. Pay attention to the q= parameter).
